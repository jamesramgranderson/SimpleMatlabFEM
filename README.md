Welcome!

I'm new to Github so forgive me if I do this weird - but I wanted to share my Matlab code with those interested!

These .m files are meant to be educational resources when learning the finite element method, as they are essentially how I wish my FEM class had been taught. The included files are as follows:

1. FESolver1DBareBones - exactly how it sounds. As simple of a multi-element FE solver as you can get. Very limited functionality but will calculate the displacements of the nodes (U vector), and some values based off of that (strain, stress, etc)
2. FESolver1DBasic - Adds features like model and results visualization to the barebones code
3. FESolver1DShapeFunctions - Uses linear shape functions (basically just linear interpolation) to add precision in calculating results to the previous code.

   More to come, as well as some Youtube introductions! Stay posted at youtube.com/@engineer_james
