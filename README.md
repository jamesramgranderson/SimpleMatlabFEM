Welcome!

I'm new to Github so forgive me if I do this weird - but I wanted to share my Matlab code with those interested!

These .m files are meant to be educational resources when learning the finite element method, as they are essentially how I wish my FEM class had been taught. The included files are as follows:

1. FESolver1DBareBones - exactly how it sounds. As simple of a multi-element FE solver as you can get. Very limited functionality but will calculate the displacements of the nodes.
2. FESolver1DBasic -
